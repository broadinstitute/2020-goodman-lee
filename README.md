Ideas:

* performance is dependent on localization—the better an object’s localization, the better the classifier
* extract less predictive, but far more interpretable classical features (e.g. color, shape, and texture descriptors)—especially useful for complex inference
* restructure the problem to use instance masks rather than static, `8 × 8` bounding boxes generated from regressed centroids
